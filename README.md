# MTG_ML
Machine Learning project for MTG cards

## Description
For our project we will be developing one or multiple machine learning algorithms to categorize and catalogue Magic the Gathering Cards.
We will be using the Scryfall Database and API in order to get the raw data and card images we need to train our model.
